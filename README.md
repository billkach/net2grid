Welcome! You have arrived at the GitHub repo for the network security team at GlobeX.  We've created this repo specifically to document our process of redeveloping the core IT infrastructure of a recent GlobeX acquisition, NET2GRID.

Our team consists of the best and brightest of the NetSec staff at GlobeX. We are Kwesi Keller, Marcus Miles, and Bill Kachersky. Because it's important to us that we are leaving this work accessible for posterity, we've made this repo public. If there's anything you find useful here, please feel free to utilize it. We'd certainly appreciate it if you'd also acknowledge where you acquired the code from in the comments of your code as well.  Thanks for viewing, and enjoy!
