### **Bill's Strengths:** 
My key strengths are my adaptability, my listening skills, and my confidence. My adaptability can be used to respond quickly to a client’s last minute requests or changes.  It can also be useful in pursuing alternative solutions if initial solutions are no longer viable.  
 
**_How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?_**
* My technical strengths are my scripting abilities and my understanding of AD.  I can use both of these to bring value to the script creation process in the first objective, as well as to navigate around the AD, and leverage my curiosity with AD to develop the solution required to understand how to authenticate captive portal credentials against AD.
 
* My listening skills will be leveraged to ensure that the clients needs are correctly understood and provided for. I will also use my listening skills to build an atmosphere of inclusivity, camaraderie, and collaboration amongst my teammates. My confidence will come into play as things heat up; grit and tenacity will be required to see the project through in the short time we have to execute and deliver the project. 


**_In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?_**
* I’d like to develop greater strength in the technical area of the craft competency. I feel that I’m not able to grasp things as well as I’d like to.  Looking forward to this project empowering me with a deeper understanding of the elements that will be required to deliver the final product to the customer.

**_Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?_**
* I plan to approach the day to day work by checking in with my team and sharing my goals for the day and finding out what their goals are, so that we can collectively check in with each other about our progress, and practice accountability to ensure that no one is stuck on one thing and that we are all working together to get done at a reasonable time each day with all goals accomplished.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

<br>

**_What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?_**

Majority vote for resolving minor conflicting ideas/interests
For more significant conflict, employ the Quality competency as a framework to navigate the conflict, employ instructors if necessary for mediation.\


**_What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?_**
We are planning to employ a consistent checklist of check in questions during our daily meetings to mitigate this potential.


**_How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?_**
Everyone doing the work together, individually on their personal Lab PCs, take the meeting times to talk about what we did, ask questions about why and how things are working the way they are.



**_How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?_**
It's important to separate personal and professional, sometimes professional can be much more direct. Acknowledging that and being ready to speak and be addressed directly/objectively for the purpose of keeping things moving along will aid in our ability to realize the best outcome.



**_How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?_**
Defer to instructors if conflict is sustained.


## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.


**_What hours will you be available to communicate?_**

General hours for communcation will be between 9-6 

Kwesi:  Mon-Tues-Wed Unavailable from 4-7, otherwise available between 7-9 
Marcus: Generally available between 9-6, flexible on the weekends
Bill: 8:30-7P each day, weekends are flexible.

**_What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?_**
Discord server for general communication

Slack best for individual communication for each teammate.

**_How often will you take breaks?_**
* 10 min breaks once every hour.

**_What is your plan if you start to fall behind?_**
* Use project management tools to measure progress
* Reach out to instructors if falling behind

**_How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?_**
* Slack, Discord

**_What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?_**
* Address what the objective is, emphasize hearing everyone's perspective on the objective.


**_How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?_**
* Personal check ins, the way we communicate (practicing inclusivity, openness, no such thing as a stupid question), humanistic dialogue around how everyone's doing during check ins.



## Work Plan
**_Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts._**
* We will be working together on all objectives, using our own Lab PCs to replicate the project locally on each of our machines, to ensure that we are all on the same page.
* We will be collectively contributing to the documentation of our process, to ensure that the process is repeatable for the client.
